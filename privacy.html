    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: 2025-01-01</p>

    <h2>1. Service Overview</h2>
    <p>SubsidyPayment provides sponsor-backed access to paid API services through ChatGPT Custom GPTs. Sponsors subsidize service costs in exchange for user engagement with promotional tasks such as surveys or data collection campaigns.</p>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account information:</strong> email address, region, roles, and tools used</li>
        <li><strong>Task completion data:</strong> responses to sponsor-required tasks (e.g., surveys)</li>
        <li><strong>Consent records:</strong> your consent choices for data sharing, contact permission, and data retention</li>
        <li><strong>Service usage data:</strong> which services you access and when</li>
        <li><strong>Session data:</strong> session tokens for authentication</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To authenticate and identify you across sessions</li>
        <li>To match you with relevant sponsored campaigns</li>
        <li>To track task completion and unlock sponsored services</li>
        <li>To process sponsor payments on your behalf</li>
        <li>To improve our service and user experience</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing with Sponsors</h2>
    <p>Your data is shared with campaign sponsors <strong>only when you explicitly consent</strong> to data sharing during task completion. If you decline data sharing consent, your task completion is still recorded but your personal data will not be transferred to the sponsor. Each sponsor campaign requires separate consent.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your data as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account data:</strong> retained while your account is active</li>
        <li><strong>Session tokens:</strong> expire after 30 days</li>
        <li><strong>Task completion records:</strong> retained for the duration of the campaign plus 90 days</li>
        <li><strong>Consent records:</strong> retained for legal compliance purposes (minimum 3 years)</li>
        <li><strong>Payment records:</strong> retained for financial audit purposes (minimum 7 years)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Withdraw consent:</strong> You may withdraw your data sharing consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before withdrawal.</li>
        <li><strong>Request data deletion:</strong> You may request deletion of your personal data. We will comply unless retention is required by law.</li>
        <li><strong>Access your data:</strong> You may request a copy of all personal data we hold about you.</li>
